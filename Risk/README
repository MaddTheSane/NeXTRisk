Risk by Mike Ferris
===================

This is the distribution for Risk version 0.98.

Risk is an implementation of the board game of the same name, for
Openstep and Rhapsody.  It supports up to six players, any number of
which can be played by the computer.

This is an update of the classic Nextstep game.  It should look and
feel very much like the original.  The source now compiles and runs on
both Openstep and Rhapsody.  It hasn't been compiled on Openstep/NT,
but this shouldn't require many changes.

Comments and suggestions are welcomed.

New since 0.97
--------------

- Version 0.98 compiles and runs under Openstep and Rhapsody.  Old
computer players are not compatible with this version, and due to
internal changes they will require a bit more than just an Openstep
conversion.

- There is a World Info panel, which gives you the name of the world,
and shows the name, number of countries, and bonus value for each
continent.  The list may be sorted by double clicking the column
title.

- I haven't run this under ObjectAlloc, so there may be a few memory
leaks.


Not added to this version (or why this isn't 1.0)
-------------------------------------------------

- Better graphics: I would love to find someone willing to do some
  graphics for me, but I haven't found anyone yet.

- Different worlds: It would be relatively easy to have more worlds
  than the standard layout.  Each world would have a name, a background
  image, images for all of the cards, and data representing continents,
  countries, and neighboring countries.  RiskUtil.app could be enhanced
  to make this easier.  Worlds could then be bundles that are
  dynamically loaded just like computer players.

- More computer strategies:  There are a few more strategies that have
  been created for the previous version, but they would need to be
  updated to work with this version.

- Saving games:  This should be quite easy, unless the following
  feature is added.

- Network multi-player option.  It might generate a lot of traffic if
  you want all the players to have dynamic updates of the number of
  armies in each country, but otherwise should be straight forward,
  since there is very little information private to players.

- Anything else you want to see (just let me know).
