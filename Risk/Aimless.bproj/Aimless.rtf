\f0\fs24 \cf0 The Aimless player is a start of a more advanced computer player.  Currently, it really only has strong fortification abilities.  It works best under the "Many to many neighboring countries" fortification rule and constant number of bonus armies.  Under these rules it quite often can beat Chaotic players, however it is still far from challenging for Humans.}
