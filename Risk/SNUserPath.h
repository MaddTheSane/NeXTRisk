/// An SNUserPath provides an interface for creating user paths and
/// using them for drawing or hit detection.  The bounding box
/// calculations are incomplete, but work with straight lines.
///
/// The MiscKit provides a more complete implementation.  Under Rhapsody
/// this will probably move towards using the <code>NSBezierPath</code> path.
///
/// Note that this means curved paths could be easily supported to
/// provide better looking maps, but RiskUtil.app would need to be
/// able to support them.
