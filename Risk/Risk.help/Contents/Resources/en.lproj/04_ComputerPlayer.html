<p class="p4">This section of the Help describes the computer players which come with Risk.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4">The only players in this version of Risk are Diagnostic and Chaotic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Source code is included for both</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><img src="../GlobalArt/DiagnosticPanel_1.png" alt="DiagnosticPanel_1.tiff"></p>
<p class="p4"><b><i>Diagnostic</i></b> is a very stupid player, but it implements a status panel which let's one monitor the computer player's operation on a very high level.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(The panel shows which ComputerPlayer utility was called last, with what arguments, and with what result.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The panel is shown below.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The strategy of Diagnostic is to do the bare minimum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He chooses countries, and places armies, but will never attack.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This player is meant to show how to incorporate .nib files into a computer player and to be subclassed by people developing new strategies.</p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><i>This is what the panel looks like after Diagnostic has placed some armies</i></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p4"><b><i>Chaotic</i></b> is my first attempt at a full featured player.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the name suggests, it is very random.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will try (at the beginning of the game) to get a country in each continent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once it succeeds (or fails) to do this, it picks random countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When placing armies it places them in random countries, but chooses only from its countries with at least one enemy neighbor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When attacking, it attacks at most one enemy country from each country that it can attack from, how long it attacks from a particular country is somewhat random.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When fortifying it tries to move armies from countries without enemy neighbors to countries with enemy neighbors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It turns in its best set of cards whenever it can.</p>
