<p></p>
<p><b><i>Chaotic</i></b> is my first attempt at a full featured player.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the name suggests, it is very random.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will try (at the beginning of the game) to get a country in each continent.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once it succeeds (or fails) to do this, it picks random countries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When placing armies it places them in random countries, but chooses only from its countries with at least one enemy neighbor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When attacking, it attacks at most one enemy country from each country that it can attack from, how long it attacks from a particular country is somewhat random.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When fortifying it tries to move armies from countries without enemy neighbors to countries with enemy neighbors.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It turns in its best set of cards whenever it can.</p>
</p>
<p>This version has been re-written in Swift, to see how ready the Objective-C headers were for Swift bridging.</p>
