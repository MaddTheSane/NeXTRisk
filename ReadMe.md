NeXTRisk
===

NeXTRisk is based off of the version of Risk coded for NeXTStep/OpenStep computers.

It has been modernized to take advantage of new classes added to AppKit, such as `NSBezierPath`s and Keyed Archiving.

And moved away from Display PostScript calls, the bane of any NeXTStep to OS X conversion (even Apple's Chess app for Jaguar uses DPS calls!).


Note that there may be comments/etc in the code/documentation that don't match to the current app works.
