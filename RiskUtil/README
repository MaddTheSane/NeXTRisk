RiskUtil is the app used to generate the RiskWorld.data object
archives.  It reads data from the following four text files:

	CardData.txt
	ContinentData.txt
	CountryData.txt
	CountryNeighbors.txt

Their format should be pretty easy to understand.

RiskUtil allows you to easily generate the neighbor data.  Just click
on a source country and release over the destination country, and
a connection will be made and shown on the map and in the neighbor list.
Lines are shown between neighbors, with long lines having a different
color to set them apart.  Connections may be removed by selecting a
pair of neighbors in the list and using the Remove button.

Use the "Write Text File" button to generate a new text file suitable
for input, so you don't have to do this by hand or make all of the
connections each time.  Use the "Save World" button to generate the
RiskWorld.data file that Risk.app will use.
