RiskPlayers is a bunch of additional computer player modules for
the famous Risk.app (by Mike Ferris).

While the players are still not strong enough to pose as ferocious
enemies they do enhance the variety of different types of computer
animated players.  Still, a slightly experienced player will not
have too much trouble winning.

The status of the implemented players is experimental, though stable
enough to not crash too often (alpha tested by Donald A. Yacktman
<don@misckit.com>, thanks).  Current implementation does not even
reflect the described strategy, but surprise might add to the fun.

Haudruf: I inherited the basic implementation together with my version
of Risk.app I think. Sources are included, hope that is ok with the
original author.  'Haudruf' is kind of german, meaning something like
'going berserk'. That pretty much describes the implemented strategy.

Coop: in a way is intended to be cooperative, whatever that means.
This is not following the mathematical definition of cooperative as
used in game theory.

Block: A refinement of Coop, currently my strongest player.  Together
with Strat (by Royce Howland  royce@splunge.uucp, kakwa!atlantis!splunge!royce)
the two opponents make interesting games.

Software comes as is, GPL copyleft should apply where no other
copyright holds. I have no intention to refine the players or invent
new strategies but Don convinced me to share the results anyway.  It
was fun for a couple of days to hack along. If you use these as basis
for further development I would sure like to know.

[Note that the source code is inside each .cp wrapper.  Since the
sources are so short, it probably doesn't matter much if you keep
them around.  If you're really pressed for disk space, you can
delete the source code and thin the binaries down... -Don Yacktman]
